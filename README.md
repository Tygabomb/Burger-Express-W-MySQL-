# Good-Burger w/ MySQL :hamburger:

## Welcome to Good burger, home of the Good burger, can I take your order? 

A Burger Eatin' Application With Node.js/Express/MySQL/Handlebars

This app makes use of basic C.R.U.D. techniques and is a full stack application. The entire frontEnd is populated by premade handlebars models and the back end is implanted with Node.js, express and MySQL. 

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database.
